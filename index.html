        <p>I live and breath software engineering. I eat codes and software architecture for my daily meals.</p>
        <p>I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success. Such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.</p>

        <h1 class="h-secondary">Experience & Skills</h1>
        <p>My years of experience and numerous experiments in software development has given me the ability to analyze business needs, collect, analyze, and visualize data, define application specifications that meet the business needs, and create a computerized system, with solid architecture and design, from scratch, that automates the business processes. I can take full responsiblity on the project's development from 0% to 100% progress, ensure that the deliverables are delivered on the promised date, develop a well-detailed documentation containing the necessary diagrams (<strong>database diagram</strong>, <strong>dataflow diagram</strong>, and <strong>business flow diagram</strong>.), technologies used, <strong>user manual</strong>.</p>
        <p>Long story short: I can turn an entire business process into a computerized system composed of various devices synchronized together.</p>

        <h1 class="h-secondary">Education</h1>
        <p>Unlike most people, I don't rely on school. Not to say that I completely dismiss it, obviously being a student on a top school where you will be taught by doctors and scientists is a great opportunity to study, but if the facilities and other resources are not complete and/or broken / damaged, then the experience will dramatically decrease. What I am saying is that, throughout my life I learned to rely on all and every resources that I can get my hands on and school here in the Philippines isn't something that I can rely on. Most professors are incompetent, no offense meant, it's just my observation. My very existence is my education and my learning.</p>

        <h1 class="h-secondary">My religion</h1>
        <p>I am more philosophical rather than religious. I think most religious people tend to be more judgemental, close-minded, and biased to their religion. I understand and respect them though, there will be no flawless belief, in each and everyone's belief you'll always find a flaw, but it goes to show that being <strong>good</strong> or <strong>evil</strong> is more of a decision than a result of being or not being religious. To clarify, I am not an athiest who rejects and even disproves the existence of God. I believe in God in the most mysterious way and when you think about it, God himself is mysterious. I also believe that there are many ways to worship God, not just through church.</p>

      <div class="cntns-standard">
        <h1 class="h-secondary">My dream.</h1>
        <p>Is to create and/or do something significant for my country, through which the future generations will benefit from, be inspired by, and will know and remember my name, my story, my character, and values.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cntns-standard">
        <h1 class="h-secondary">I'm a lone wolf</h1>
        <p>I have qualities only few can admire because most don't possess. I have strengths only few can understand because most have never experienced.</p>
        <p>Being a lone wolf doesn't mean I do things solely on my own, it means that I am self reliant and I know how to get things done with or without the help of other people. I also don't accept help from people who are not as enthusiastic as I am.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="cntns-standard">
        <h1 class="h-secondary">One of the things I hate.</h1>
        <p>The worst thing you would do to your people is put them under control. Why? Because that will suppress their talent and force them to perform at their worst.</p>
